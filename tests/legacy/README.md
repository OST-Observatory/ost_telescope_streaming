Legacy Tests (Deprecated)

This folder contains legacy or script-style tests that have been superseded by modern pytest unit/integration tests.

- These files are kept for historical context and potential manual reference.
- They are excluded from normal test runs.
- Prefer tests under `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`.
